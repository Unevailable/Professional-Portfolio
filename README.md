## Description

    I was tasked to make a portfolio using a webpage. This would contain projects I worked on, about me, resume, and contact information.

## Installation
    Firstly, I created a github repo, next I opened up my git bash and added all of the files that i needed. When I started go into the coding part I used challenge one's code for the skeleton of my project. Afterwards I added css coding to make the page look better and to make the webpage accessible to moblie users. Lastly, I upated the live page.

## Usage

The Purpose of the website was to give employers a website made to be a portofilo. By doing this it gives employers an easier time colleting information and for me to have all my information already organized.
