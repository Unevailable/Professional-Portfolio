## Description

    I was tasked to make a portfolio using a webpage. This would contain projects I worked on, about me, my resume, and contact information.

## Installation
    Firstly, I created a GitHub repo, next, I opened up my git bash and added all of the files that I needed. When I started going into the coding part I used challenge one's code for the skeleton of my project. Afterward, I added CSS coding to make the page look clean. Lastly, I updated the live page.

## Usage

The Purpose of the website was to give employers a website made to be a portfolio. Doing this gives employers an easier time collecting information and for me to have all my information already organized.
